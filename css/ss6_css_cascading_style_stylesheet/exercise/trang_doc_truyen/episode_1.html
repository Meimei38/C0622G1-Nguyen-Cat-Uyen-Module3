                “What is truth? The negation of lies? Or the statement of a fact? <br>And if the fact is a lie, what
                then is the truth?” <br>

            “It is easy to kill with a bow, girl. <br>How easy it is to release the bowstring and think, it is not I, it
            is the arrow. <br>The blood of that boy is not on my hands. The arrow killed him, not I. But the arrow does
            not dream anything in the night.” <br>

                “every myth, every fable must have some roots. Something lies among those roots.' <br>
                'It does. ... Most often a dream, a wish, a desire, a yearning. Faith that there are no limits to
                possibility. And occasionally chance.” <br>
            </p>
            “Because I know that in order to unite two people, destiny is insufficient. Something more is necessary than
            destiny.” <br>

                “For me,” mused Dandelion, “a mattress without a young woman isn't a mattress at all. It is incomplete
                happiness...” <br>
